# Portfolio

## Purpose of Assignment:

The purpose of this assignment was to create a general portfolio that will eventually display my general information, as well as, past and present projects that I have created and/or collaborated on. 

## How To Use:

This site was built to be very user friendly and easy to navigate. When you click on any of the links in the nav bar it will take you to that particular section of the page itself. It has dedicated columns and rows set up for easy readability. There are also links in the 'Contact Me' section that allow you to send emails directly to me and navigate to my github home page. There are placeholder images where my projects will eventually be displayed.
